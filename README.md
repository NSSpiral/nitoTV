nitoTV
======

nitoTV for AppleTV 2/3, iOS 6+ compat

NOTE: There is a new folder called 'missing headers', you will need to implement those as necessary to get this to build properly, originally they were hackily added to my Prefix.pch file in the version of theos in specifically used to build this. theres a chance you might need and old iOS sdk as well (i used to build this against the 4.3 sdk)


*** this is not a maintained / supported project. i just updated some headers and the README with the AppleTV 3 jailbreak that is out now. ***
